# S.P.E.E.D: Autonomous Racing AI



This project uses Unity ML-Agents to train and compare racing agents.  

\- \*\*95% faster training\*\* with optimized agent configs  

\- Includes both deep RL and heuristic agents  

\- All code, configs, and results are here for easy testing and learning!



\## Folders

\- `docs/`: Project report and documentation

\- `config/`: ML-Agents YAML configs

\- `scripts/`: Unity C# agent scripts

\- `results/`: Performance data and analysis

\- `training/`: Python training pipeline



\## How to Use

1\. Open the Unity project and add the agent scripts.

2\. Use the YAML configs to train agents with ML-Agents.

3\. Check `results/` for performance data and comparisons.
